TODOs
------
Usability:
- Refactor logging to make it more consistent.
- Add to String methods to messages/attributes.
- In message module use existing builders in factories too, if possible (currently own checks are implemented by factories)

Functionality:
- Make a TncsHandler which can read an evaluation policy from a file.
- Make a IMV example which can read an evaluation policy from a file.
- Not null checking (already done for several situations, but there may be more)  
- - Proper not null check for arguments in all writer/reader classes.
- - Check if factory constructors do proper if null checking
- - Check if builders do proper null checking
- Implement StringPrep protocol with SaslPrep version for Sasl PLAIN/EXTERNAL Methods
